              <p>Amazon Payments wanted to serve a greater swathe of shoppers by accepting more payment methods&mdash;like cash&mdash;during 2017's rapid company expansion.</p>
              <p>This complex project was the first of its kind in the now larger, freshly restructured org. As lead designer, I spearheaded integrating UX into Consumer Payments and broadly working across other major teams (like Your Orders and Returns) at Amazon.</p>
              <p>My task was to incorporate this method in the byzantine, sparsely-documented Amazon.com checkout processes. I worked closely with product, engineering, and an external research firm to iterate towards a simple yet global solution.</p>

              <p>It also threaded into a large-scale upgrade of properties to responsive design. I acted as design lead for a series of pitches to improve the homepage.
