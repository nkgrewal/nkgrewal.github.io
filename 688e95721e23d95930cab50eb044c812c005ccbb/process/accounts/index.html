          <h1>Pro Admin &amp; API</h1>
          <p>This project was one of the Pro product's most clearly thought-out and massive UX changes at the time. It threaded into several large-scale projects like the move to SSO (single sign-on), Developer API launch, and a viral marketing campaign moving targeted users from consumer site to Pro.</p>

          <p>Initially, the scope was a reskin to match our rebrand. These screens give an overview of Account Settings, Site Administration, and the plans available for purchase.</p>

          <p>I had recently designed the new Pro API Developer portal to be clean and approachable, However, it was too disparate and enough thought wasn't given into showing how it would integrate with the rest of our services.</p>

          <p>Initial attempt to give the account settings page a facelift, before we discovered deeper usability issues. Important existential questions came up like "Who is going to be using this stuff? Who manages users? Why? What do users do in account settings? What do first time users expect to do when they go into it? What don't they use in it?"</p>

          <p>Interviews with customers and internal users of Pro revealed areas in the accounts structure that could benefit from further analysis. I tagged along to meetings to ask specific usability questions and watch users interact with the tool overall. Between product and development, we had a few collaborative discussions to suss out goals for rethinking the account structure and what the effort might look like for that. With that info, I began to map out our collective research and conclusions to see what would make sense for users.</p>
          <p>Survey: positive for tool, desire to see better account management and search capability, more knowledge of which industries use Pro and how.</p>
          <p>In-person interviews revealed more nuanced info. Two major areas we needed to do better for our customers was helping them manage their users/teams and see their usage of Pro. We figured out that we needed a tiered system with roles and permissions, and make usage stats more accessible. Uncovered basic structure that would work well for accounts (owner, more hands off; team lead, does actual acct management; agent, does actual searches in tool.</p>

          <p>This was a large undertaking that would ultimately affect every level of the Pro team, from sales to product to marketing. To get ahead of any issues that might crop up due to lack of information or communication, we decided to try a page out of the <a href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Design Spring</a> and include the larger team in brainstorming. While mapping out flows and requirements, we also held a session with the Seattle team and later the Budapest team.</p>
