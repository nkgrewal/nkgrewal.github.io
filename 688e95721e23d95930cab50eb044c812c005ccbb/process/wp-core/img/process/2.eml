Hi Navreen,

A little bit more than the comments I provided to you verbally today.
Regarding ad revenue impacts, that=B9s something where Rob/Bret will need to
chime in based on what info Meixner provides them.
* Screenshot #1: I think this one has real potential. It=B9s simple and gets
rid of all the redundancy between homepage content and nav bar that our
current homepage has. I=B9d prefer the logo in grey. When the logo is rendere=
d
somewhere on the black-white  greyscale, it somehow feels like it=B9s more
brand compliant with WhitePages than if it=B9s in green. Those are my $0.02,
and I could be argued out of it. I also think that the ads feel a bit
disjointed. I get that the banner  ad is centered on the page, but it still
doesn=B9t align nicely with any of the content below, which creates an overal=
l
haphazard look. The simplest fix here would be to go without a banner ad on
the homepage (especially given that there is so little content  on the
homepage anyway), but I fear that it might cost too much in ad revenue.
* Screenshot #2: Feels cluttered. Lots of text (users prefer to =B3scan=B2
instead of read, unless they are visiting a page where they are in a
=B3reading mode=B2, such as an about-us page). Also, lots of loud icons
competing for attention. (Someone told me  once that a logo icon is proven
to be a 10/10 as far as dialing up the volume. It=B9s the loudest form of
graphic icon, and in this case, there are tons of them.)
* Screenshot #3: Beautiful and functional! I just wish that we didn=B9t have
all these issues on the ad serving side at this time, which are putting lot=
s
of pressure on our revenues and limits our ability to cut key ads. Would be
curious how this page  looks with the ads added back in. One minor mod on
this mockup is that the =B3Search=B2 button is a bit overpowering. I like the
orange, but it might suffice to just have the magnifying glass icon in the
orange button, and drop =B3Search=B2 from the button. (Also,  not sure what it
means that this implementation would have =B3smooth scrolling/anchor=B2.
* Screenshots #4 and onward: I prefer the hero treatment for the search for=
m
on the homepage. After all, this is what >98% of users will click, so it
feels a little weird to relegate the search form to a less prominent
location at the top of the page.

Kevin and Alex,

Attached* are some of the homepage ideas we had, and we=B9d love to get your
feedback on it early on. With the new mind-blowing nav the team has been
diligently working on, the need to rethink the homepage has been apparent i=
n
our design challenges  and with the feedback we=B9ve gotten. Calum and I thin=
k
this is a good opportunity to try some of the concepts the design team
worked on from the =B3Conceptual Work=B2 presentation.

Some notes on them:

> All pages - Copy is all placeholder. We=B9ll work with marketing to flesh i=
t out
>=20
> 1-2 : Focused on the search bar with products (currently just links on th=
e
> page) fleshed out below.
>=20
> 3-7 : Concept with no ads on the page and smooth scrolling/anchor. We tri=
ed to
> think of ways we could keep advertising revenue on it like skinning, but =
tone
> down the competing branding.

These ideas will need more refinement, and we=B9d love to get your thoughts
early.

Thanks!
Navreen
