              <p>With desktop and mobile closer to feature parity, the teams now shifted from platform silo'd workflows to coordinating feature delivery across web, mobile, and desktop. We had a list of top user requested features (like an "out of office" setting) as well as team-sourced ideas for enhancements. Additionally, the mobile project unlocked a path to adding profile pictures, which had yet to be integrated on desktop.</p>
              <p>With limited PM resources, it was important to continue flexing the benefits of the design process that were leveraged during the mobile project. Again, I was given a high degree of ownership to define the project and its opportunities. This time, I had the help of a junior designer and a UX researcher.</p>

              <p>Amazon Payments org wanted to serve a greater swathe of shoppers by accepting more payment methods&mdash;like cash&mdash;during 2017's rapid company expansion.</p>
              <p>It may seem surprising for e-commerce, but physical currency still has a strong influence on purchasing behaviors across the world (and it's considerably cheaper to process than credit cards). Many countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia already have voucher-like payments enmeshed in their economy, both offline and online.</p>
              <p>I was tasked with integrating this complex method into the byzantine workings of Amazon.com's checkout process. The project was the first of its kind in the now larger, freshly restructured org. It served as a guinea pig for UX integration into Consumer Payments, as well as broadly working across other major teams at Amazon.</p>

              <p>All Star Directories sought to build a suite of mobile apps that support new students and improve institutional retention rates.</p>
              <p>For adults returning to school, relearning how to be a student is a daunting obstacle on top of life's other demands. Drop-out rates for the first semester alone are the highest. TASL's ambition was to improve outcomes for new students through their first quarter, first year, and hopefully to graduation.</p>
              <p>In 2016, I got a chance to design Study Shift&mdash;a study tracking app&mdash;and Reading Comprehension&mdash;an app that teaches and reinforces critical reading skills&mdash;from the ground up. With just 3 people, our team ran like a hackathon and made incredible progress within 6 months.</p>
