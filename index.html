Under the umbrella of a "5.0" release, we coordinated front-end, API, and back-end service overhauls for web, desktop, and mobile apps. The end goal was to support larger daily meeting demands and open opportunities for productivity add-ons.</p>

                  <h4>Goal</h4>
                  <p>All Star Directories sought consultants to build a suite of speculative mobile apps. For adults returning to school, rediscovering and developing fundamentals of being a student is often challenging. Drop-out rate for the first semester alone is highest. The TASL project had the ambition to build a suite of apps that improve outcomes of new students through their first quarter, first year, and even hopefully to graduation.</p>
                  <h4>Role</h4>
                  <p>From the ground up, I got the chance to design Study Shift, a study tracking app, and Reading Comprehension, an app that teaches and reinforces reading skills. Our team ran like hackathon with 3 people&mdash; a PM, an engineer, and myself.</p>

                  <h4>DESIGN</h4>
                  <p>All Star had a new logo, but the website still reflected their old branding. We needed to update the design to align to our new direction with strong messaging on the following three attributes: Quality, Compliance, and Consistency. I worked with the creative director to make an experience that felt more genuine and authentic while utilizing white space and vivid colors in a unique way.</p>
                  <h4>THE EVOLUTION</h4>
                  <p>The creative director and I collaborated with content and business development to work out a style that would represent the company's changes and build an identity. All Star had undergone many changes to position itself as an industry leader, and they wanted this image to be loud and clear throughout the site's design and content. The rebrand was an effort to revitalize All Star's B-to-B image with customers and partners without alienating them with excessive change. Success of this endeavor would then influence rebranding for revenue-generating properties on the B-to-C side.</p>

CAKES needed to be portrayed as a <strong>trendy fashion accessory</strong>that could be personalized and worn decoratively as well as practically.</p>
                  <h4>THE PRESENCE</h4>

              <p class="large">SEATTLE (AP) &mdash; The web designer based in Seattle is faced with prosecution for allegedly biting a man in a bacon costume at the Fremont Food Truck Rodeo.</p>
              <p>The perpetrator claims to have mistaken him for a real piece of bacon the size of a human adult. "It did seem like it was too good to be true when I gave it some more thought later," she admitted to authorities.</p>
              <p>Upon further questioning, the accused attempted the plead the fifth. When she realized she wasn't quite sure what that was, she pleaded <em>"Really Hungry At the Time."</em></p>
              <p>The media frenzy surrounding this event, and inflamed by a slow news day, led journalists to delve into the accused's past. She has a well-recorded history of bacon-infatuation, as well a propensity for creative cries for attention, including, but not limited to, fabricating news stories.</p>
              <p>Bacon Man has declined to comment.</p>

                    My philosophy is that attentive research, thoughtful process, and collaborative teams are the keys to success.
                  I'm a swiss army designer. Crafting experiences that resonate with an audience is one of the most rewarding things to me. Breathing life into it just takes it a level further, which is why I also dabble in HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript.</p>
                  <p>I've designed across a range of different mediums in my career, from interactive to print to motion. My ability to come up with solid solutions across mediums comes from strong design fundamentals and a desire to understand these processes, as well as how they influence each other.</p>
