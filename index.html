                  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                  <p>We needed a way to package on-brand print and digital collateral in a customizable way. It had to elegantly give an overview of GalaxySuite products while differentiating them, so I created a "playing card" version of each product. With fun yet descriptive icons, we aimed for a design that felt more genuine and authentic while utilizing white space and vivid colors in a unique way.</p>
                  <h3>PRODUCTS</h3>
                  <p>The GalaxySuite is a collection of marketing services recently created by All Star's business development team. The sales team needed a way to selectively introduce certain services to customers. The collateral package would inform customers of the benefits to their business if they had this particular "card up their sleeve."</p>

We needed to update the design to align to our new direction with strong messaging on the following three attributes: Quality, Compliance, and Consistency. I worked with the creative director to make an experience that felt more genuine and authentic while utilizing white space and vivid colors in a unique way.</p>
                  <h3>THE EVOLUTION</h3>
                  <p>The creative director and I collaborated with content and business development to work out a style that would represent the company's changes and build an identity. All Star had undergone many changes to position itself as an industry leader, and they wanted this image to be loud and clear throughout the site's design and content. The rebrand was an effort to revitalize All Star's B-to-B image with customers and partners without alienating them with excessive change. Success of this endeavor would then influence rebranding for revenue-generating properties on the B-to-C side.</p>

CAKES needed to be portrayed as a <strong>trendy fashion accessory</strong>that could be personalized and worn decoratively as well as practically.</p>
                  <h3>THE PRESENCE</h3>

              <p>The perpetrator claims to have mistaken him for a real piece of bacon the size of a human adult. "It did seem like it was too good to be true when I gave it some more thought later," she admitted to authorities.</p>
              <p>Upon further questioning, the accused attempted the plead the fifth. When she realized she wasn't quite sure what that was, she proceeded to plead <em>"Really Hungry At the Time."</em></p>
              <p>The media frenzy, incited by a slow news day and this event, led journalists to delve into the accused's past. She has a well-recorded history of bacon-infatuation, as well a propensity for creative cries for attention, including, but not limited to, fabricating news stories.</p>
