              <p>Why "swiss army designer"?* Design is first and foremost my passion and strength. Creating a beautiful design that resonates with an audience is one of the most rewarding things to me. Breathing life into it just takes it a level further, which is why I also do front-end development in Javascript and Actionscript.</p>
              <p class="note">*It's also what I called myself to the marketing team. Jokes about "being a bit of a tool" may have already been made. Mostly by me.</p>

                  <h3>FIXED</h3>
                  <p>Rather than just deliver it in the form of an HTML table, I built a Flash piece that would replace that table on page load and allow users to get information on cities that are relevant to them. To templatize the infographic without having to get into Flash (for the convenience of the content team, as well as myself), I stored the data in an external XML file.</p>

                  <h3>THE BRANDING</h3>
                  <p>LeadsCon was the first foray into rebranding efforts with the new logo. The company had a loose idea of what direction they wanted to go, and this event was the impetus to shape it even further. Coordinating with business development, we decided that the messaging needed to convey to current and potential partners that All Star had established its priority as being a lead provider of quality and consistency in the industry, and therefore a key to success.</p>
                  <h3>THE CONUNDRUM</h3>
                  <p>With this in mind, I created a design that would stand apart from the overly glossy ads of our competitors. They tended to lean on trendy, web 2.0 designs and stock imagery. I aimed for a design that felt more genuine, authentic, and utilized white space in a way that the dead-center text ads did not. One of the solutions I created, which would be the final choice, was a poster style ad that put the "wordle" which spelled SUCCEED in the forefront and used the All Star symbol to balance it. The bold shapes and label-like quality of the SUCCEED wordle lent itself well to the variety of final products it needed to transition onto.</p>

                  <p>Its cyclical nature and the speed of escalation can be found in numerous examples both present and past, from <a href"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4vI18HJM2o">Darfur to Myanmar to Iraq</a>. By juxtaposing the present and the past, I attempted to make those observations palpable to the audience.</p>

                  <p>Expressing the above in video with limited assets.</p>

                <div class="info2">
                  <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                  <p>The original idea behind this project was to explore the dynamic between visuals and sound in the form of a music video. The exercise involved setting free music from <a href="http://www.renderyard.com/index.php#.UF_CG1FMcWc">renderyard</a> to a collection of random footage from the <a href="http://archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=prelinger">Prelinger Archives</a>.</p>
                  <p>While I continued to research and collect video in December '08, the ceasefire between Israel and Palestine was broken, and the Gaza War began. Al-Jazeera announced that they were releasing their footage online under Creative Commons licensing, which I leveraged to compare to the older videos I found on Prelinger. The first scenes are from <a href="http://archive.org/details/ScreenTr1936">a tourist view of Damascus and Jerusalem in 1936</a>. From there, the footage transitions into scenes from <a href="http://archive.org/details/sands_of_sorrow">Sands of Sorrow</a> (which I really recommend seeing the entirety of). As the camera follows the road that many refugees had walked fleeing old Palestine to Gaza, I tried to create a transition of time as well as place. The roads, the people, the makeshift homes, they are different but the same. Over 50 years later, the next generation has grown only knowing this reality, and I tried to address that.</p>

                  <p>I like making things that connect with people. Sometimes to make them laugh, ideally make them think, and hopefully to evoke a genuine reaction. It's why I've always enjoyed designing in an interactive/interaction capacity. It's a sort of dialogue that happens on an instinctual level, which makes it feel very authentic.</p>
                  <p>In my past experience, I've designed across a range of different mediums, from interactive to print to motion. It has given me an in-depth understanding of each and how good design can be the meeting ground for them all. My ability to come up with solid solutions across these mediums comes from strong design fundamentals and a desire to understand these processes as well as how they influence each other.</p>

                  <p>I've designed across a range of different mediums, from web to print to motion, and my previous design experience has given me a deep understanding of interactive, motion, web, and the extensive gray areas in which they all overlap. I think my ability to come up with solid solutions for many of them comes from strong design fundamentals and trying to explore the best techniques for each process. I've picked up a plethora of skills, most recently a lot of Javascript for front-end development, purely out of a desire to create things and see them in action.</p>
                   <p>I'm a swiss army designer. Design is first and foremost my passion and strength. Creating a beautiful design that resonates with an audience is one of the most rewarding things to me. Breathing life into it just takes it a level further, which is why I also do front-end development in Javascript and Actionscript (in addition to HTML &amp; CSS). I've become a multi-disciplinary designer, and that experience has shown me that really solid design, especially with interactive, doesn't begin and end in Photoshop.</p>
