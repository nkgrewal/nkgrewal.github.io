                <p>Consequent to COVID-19 lockdowns, the Amazon Chime team tackled sweeping upgrades to accomodate the significant surge of remote meetings.</p>
                <p>The product was not optimized for the sudden shift in meeting dynamics (being largely unchanged since its acquisition as "Biba" in 2016). We started to understand the new normal, and the team quested to overhaul services from back-end to front-end under a "5.0" release. The modernizations would accelerate future productivity add-ons, support additional use cases, and get the product up to accessibility standards.</p>
                <p>I focused on meeting these goals for our mobile/tablet users. I also saw an opportunity to build a more customer-centric process and improve known issues with cross-team communication and efficiency.</p>

                <p>During 2017's rapid company expansion, the Amazon Payments org endeavored to serve a greater swathe of shoppers and accept more payment methods&mdash;like cash.</p>
                <p>While it may seem surprising for e-commerce, physical currency still has a strong influence on purchasing behaviors across the world, and it's considerably cheaper to process than credit cards. Many countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia already have voucher-like payments enmeshed in their economy.</p>
                <p>I was tasked with integrating this complex method into the byzantine workings of Amazon's checkout process. The project was the first of its kind in the now larger, freshly restructured org; it served as a guinea pig for UX integration, as well as more broadly figuring out how to work together and across other teams at Amazon.</p>

              <p>SEATTLE (AP) &mdash; The web designer based in Seattle is faced with prosecution for allegedly biting a man in a bacon costume at the Fremont Food Truck Rodeo.</p>
              <p>The perpetrator claims to have mistaken him for a real piece of bacon the size of a human adult. "It did seem like it was too good to be true when I gave it some more thought later," she admitted to authorities.</p>
              <p>Upon further questioning, the accused attempted the plead the fifth. When she realized she wasn't quite sure what that was, she pleaded <em>"Really Hungry At the Time."</em></p>
              <p>The media frenzy surrounding this event, and inflamed by a slow news day, led journalists to delve into the accused's past. She has a well-recorded history of bacon-infatuation, as well a propensity for creative cries for attention, including, but not limited to, fabricating news stories.</p>
              <p>Bacon Man has declined to comment.</p>
