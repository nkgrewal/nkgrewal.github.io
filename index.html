              <p>SEATTLE (AP) &mdash; The web designer based in Seattle is faced with prosecution for allegedly biting a man in a bacon costume at the Fremont Food Truck Rodeo.</p>
              <p>The perpetrator claims to have mistaken him for a real piece of bacon the size of a human adult. "It did seem like it was too good to be true when I gave it some more thought later," she admitted to authorities.</p>
              <p>Upon further questioning, the accused attempted the plead the fifth. When she realized she wasn't quite sure what that was, she pleaded <em>"Really Hungry At the Time."</em></p>
              <p>The media frenzy surrounding this event, and inflamed by a slow news day, led journalists to delve into the accused's past. She has a well-recorded history of bacon-infatuation, as well a propensity for creative cries for attention, including, but not limited to, fabricating news stories.</p>
              <p>Bacon Man has declined to comment.</p>

              Tech is elementally human. Whether it's Stone Age flint for fire or looking up a new career path on a phone, it's about making life better for people. My philosophy is that attentive research, thoughtful process, and collaborative teams are the keys to success.</p>
              <p>I've designed across a range of different mediums in my career, from interactive to print to motion. My ability to come up with solid solutions across mediums comes from strong design fundamentals and a desire to understand these processes, as well as how they influence each other.</p>
              <p>I'm a swiss army designer. Crafting experiences that resonate with an audience is one of the most rewarding things to me. Breathing life into it just takes it a level further, which is why I also dabble in HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript.</p>
