              <p>With COVID-19 lockdowns, Amazon Chime tackled sweeping upgrades to support the surge in remote meetings.</p>
              <p>The product was largely unchanged since its 2016 acquisition and wasn't optimized for the shift in meeting dynamics. The team quested to overhaul services from back-end to front-end under a mega "5.0" release. These modernizations would accelerate future productivity add-ons, support additional use cases, and get the product up to accessibility standards.</p>
              <p>I focused on meeting these goals for our mobile/tablet users. I also saw an opportunity to build a more customer-centric process and improve known issues with cross-team communication and efficiency.</p>

              <p>Amazon Payments org wanted to serve a greater swathe of shoppers by accepting more payment methods&mdash;like cash&mdash;during 2017's rapid company expansion.</p>
              <p>It may seem surprising for e-commerce, but physical currency still has a strong influence on purchasing behaviors across the world (and it's considerably cheaper to process than credit cards). Many countries like Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia already have voucher-like payments enmeshed in their economy, both offline and online.</p>
              <p>I was tasked with integrating this complex method into the byzantine workings of Amazon.com's checkout process. The project was the first of its kind in the now larger, freshly restructured org. It served as a guinea pig for UX integration into Consumer Payments, as well as broadly working across other major teams at Amazon.</p>
