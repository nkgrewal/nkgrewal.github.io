                  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                  <p>We needed a way to package on-brand print and digital collateral in a customizable way. It had to elegantly give an overview of GalaxySuite products while differentiating them, so I created a "playing card" version of each product. With fun yet descriptive icons, we aimed for a design that felt more genuine and authentic while utilizing white space and vivid colors in a unique way.</p>
                  <h3>PRODUCTS</h3>
                  <p>The GalaxySuite is a collection of marketing services recently created by All Star's business development team. The sales team needed a way to selectively introduce certain services to customers. The collateral package would inform customers of the benefits to their business if they had this particular "card up their sleeve."</p>

                  <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                  <p>All Star had a new logo, but the website still reflected their old branding. We needed to update the design to align to our new direction with strong messaging on the following three attributes: Quality, Compliance, and Consistency. I worked with the creative director to make an experience that felt more genuine and authentic while utilizing white space and vivid colors in a unique way.</p>
                  <h3>THE EVOLUTION</h3>
                  <p>The creative director and I collaborated with content and business development to work out a style that would represent the company's changes and build an identity. All Star had undergone many changes to position itself as an industry leader, and they wanted this image to be loud and clear throughout the site's design and content. The rebrand was an effort to revitalize All Star's B-to-B image with customers and partners without alienating them with excessive change. Success of this endeavor would then influence rebranding for revenue-generating properties on the B-to-C side.</p>

                  <h3>FIXED</h3>
                  <p>Rather than just deliver it in the form of an HTML table, I built a Flash piece that would replace that table on page load and allow users to get information on cities that are relevant to them. To templatize the infographic without having to get into Flash (for the convenience of the content team, as well as myself), I stored the data in an external XML file.</p>

                  <h3>THE BRANDING</h3>
                  <p>LeadsCon was the first foray into rebranding efforts with the new logo. The company had a loose idea of what direction they wanted to go, and this event was the impetus to shape it even further. Coordinating with business development, we decided that the messaging needed to convey to current and potential partners that All Star had established its priority as being a lead provider of quality and consistency in the industry, and therefore a key to success.</p>
                  <h3>THE CONUNDRUM</h3>
                  <p>With this in mind, I created a design that would stand apart from the overly glossy ads of our competitors. They tended to lean on trendy, web 2.0 designs and stock imagery. I aimed for a design that felt more genuine, authentic, and utilized white space in a way that the dead-center text ads did not. One of the solutions I created, which would be the final choice, was a poster style ad that put the "wordle" which spelled SUCCEED in the forefront and used the All Star symbol to balance it. The bold shapes and label-like quality of the SUCCEED wordle lent itself well to the variety of final products it needed to transition onto.</p>

                  <h3>PROCESS</h3>
                  <p>The original idea behind this project was to explore the dynamic between visuals and sound in the form of a music video. The exercise involved setting free music from <a href="http://www.renderyard.com/index.php#.UF_CG1FMcWc">renderyard</a> to a collection of random footage from the <a href="http://archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&mediatype=movies&collection=prelinger">Prelinger Archives</a>.</p>
                  <p>While I continued to research and collect video in December '08, the ceasefire between Israel and Palestine was broken, and the Gaza War began. Al-Jazeera announced that they were releasing their footage online under Creative Commons licensing, which I leveraged to compare to the older videos I found on Prelinger. The first scenes are from <a href="http://archive.org/details/ScreenTr1936">a tourist view of Damascus and Jerusalem in 1936</a>. From there, the footage transitions into scenes from <a href="http://archive.org/details/sands_of_sorrow">Sands of Sorrow</a> (which I really recommend seeing the entirety of). As the camera follows the road that many refugees had walked fleeing old Palestine to Gaza, I tried to create a transition of time as well as place. The roads, the people, the makeshift homes, they are different but the same. Over 50 years later, the next generation has grown only knowing this reality, and I tried to address that.</p>

              <p>The perpetrator claims to have mistaken him for a real piece of bacon the size of a human adult. "It did seem like it was too good to be true when I gave it some more thought later," she admitted to authorities.</p>
              <p>Upon further questioning, the accused attempted the plead the fifth. When she realized she wasn't quite sure what that was, she proceeded to plead <em>"Really Hungry At the Time."</em></p>
              <p>The media frenzy, incited by a slow news day and this event, led journalists to delve into the accused's past. She has a well-recorded history of bacon-infatuation, as well a propensity for creative cries for attention, including, but not limited to, fabricating news stories.</p>

                  <p>I like making things that connect with people. Sometimes to make them laugh, ideally make them think, and hopefully to evoke a genuine reaction. It's why I've always enjoyed designing in an interactive/interaction capacity. It's a sort of dialogue that happens on an instinctual level, which makes it feel very authentic.</p>
                  <p>In my past experience, I've designed across a range of different mediums, from interactive to print to motion. It has given me an in-depth understanding of each and how good design can be the meeting ground for them all. My ability to come up with solid solutions across these mediums comes from strong design fundamentals and a desire to understand these processes as well as how they influence each other.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="info2">
                  <p>I've designed across a range of different mediums, from web to print to motion, and my previous design experience has given me a deep understanding of interactive, motion, web, and the extensive gray areas in which they all overlap. I think my ability to come up with solid solutions for many of them comes from strong design fundamentals and trying to explore the best techniques for each process. I've picked up a plethora of skills, most recently a lot of Javascript for front-end development, purely out of a desire to create things and see them in action.</p>
                   <p>I'm a swiss army designer. Design is first and foremost my passion and strength. Creating a beautiful design that resonates with an audience is one of the most rewarding things to me. Breathing life into it just takes it a level further, which is why I also do front-end development in Javascript and Actionscript (in addition to HTML &amp; CSS). I've become a multi-disciplinary designer, and that experience has shown me that really solid design, especially with interactive, doesn't begin and end in Photoshop.</p>
